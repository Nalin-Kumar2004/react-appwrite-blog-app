### Sticky Footer & Responsiveness
- **User Request:** Make the footer always sit at the bottom (sticky footer) and check if the app is responsive.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/App.jsx` to use `flex flex-col min-h-screen` and `main` with `flex-1`.
  - This ensures the footer always sits at the bottom, with no extra space below.
  - Confirmed that Tailwind's responsive classes are used throughout the app, so the app is responsive by default.
- **Code Comments:**
  - Added a comment in `App.jsx` explaining the sticky footer layout and why the change was made.
