### Sticky Footer & Responsiveness
- **User Request:** Make the footer always sit at the bottom (sticky footer) and check if the app is responsive.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/App.jsx` to use `flex flex-col min-h-screen` and `main` with `flex-1`.
  - This ensures the footer always sits at the bottom, with no extra space below.
  - Confirmed that Tailwind's responsive classes are used throughout the app, so the app is responsive by default.
- **Code Comments:**
  - Added a comment in `App.jsx` explaining the sticky footer layout and why the change was made.

### Unified Blog Color Palette
- **User Request:** Choose and apply the best, production-safe color palette for the whole app.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/index.css` with a modern, readable palette:
    - Primary accent: blue-600 (#2563eb)
    - Background: slate-50 (#f8fafc)
    - Card/Header/Footer: white (#fff)
    - Text: slate-800 (#1e293b)
    - Subtle border: slate-200 (#e5e7eb)
    - Hover: blue-700 (#1d4ed8)

  - Ensures a consistent, professional look across all pages.

### UI Enhancements for a Polished Blog Look

- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/index.css`:
    - Made the main content background lighter for a brighter feel.
    - Added a subtle shadow and border to the header for separation.
    - Added a hover underline effect to header nav links for interactivity.
    - Added a border to cards for better definition.
    - Added a top shadow to the footer for separation.
  - All changes are clearly commented in the CSS.

  - These enhancements make the app look more polished, modern, and visually appealing while keeping it simple and professional.

### Unique, Branded Blog Background
- **User Request:** Make the background more unique and branded to match the blue navbar accent.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/index.css`:
    - Switched to a subtle blue gradient background (`#e0ecfa` to `#f8fafc`) for depth and a modern, branded feel.
    - Kept header, footer, and cards white for contrast and readability.
  - All changes are clearly commented in the CSS.
- **Why:**
  - The blue gradient background ties in with the blue navbar accent, making the app feel more cohesive and visually appealing.
  - Still maintains a clean, professional look suitable for a blog.

### Three-Column, Balanced Footer Layout
- **User Request:** Update footer to a balanced three-column layout (logo left, links center, copyright right) and keep changelog/comments.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/components/Footer/Footer.jsx`:
    - Used flexbox to create three columns: logo (left), navigation links (center), copyright (right).
    - Responsive: stacks vertically on mobile, columns on desktop.
    - Added clear comments for future reference.
- **Why:**
  - This layout is visually balanced, professional, and familiar to users.
  - Works well for production blogs and business sites.

### SVG Logo Component
- **User Request:** Add a logo to the site for a more professional, branded appearance.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/components/Logo.jsx`:
    - Replaced the text 'Logo' with a simple SVG logo (blue square and 'Blog' text) for branding.
    - Added a comment explaining how to swap the SVG for a custom logo later.
- **Why:**
  - An SVG logo looks more polished and production-ready than plain text.
  - Easy to customize for your own brand in the future.

### Post Page Layout & Readability Fix
- **User Request:** The post image appears too large, and the heading/content are not organized or readable.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/pages/Post.jsx`:
    - Limited the post image's max height and made it responsive (`max-h-[400px] w-auto object-contain shadow-md`).
    - Centered and enlarged the post title for emphasis.
    - Wrapped the post content in a styled, centered card (`max-w-2xl bg-white bg-opacity-80 rounded-lg p-6 shadow`).
    - Added comments to explain all changes.
  - All changes are clearly commented in the CSS.
- **Why:**
  - These changes make the post page much more readable, visually appealing, and professional.
  - Prevents images from overflowing and keeps content organized.

### TinyMCE Deprecation Fix & PostForm Error Handling
- **User Request:** Remove deprecated TinyMCE plugins/options and fix PostForm `$id` error.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/components/RTE.jsx`:
    - Removed deprecated plugins: `textcolor`, `colorpicker` from the TinyMCE config.
    - Removed deprecated options: `templates`, `textcolor_rows`, `textcolor_map`.
    - Added comments for clarity.
  - Updated `src/components/post-form/PostForm.jsx`:
    - Added a check at the start of the submit function to ensure `userData` and `userData.$id` are defined before proceeding.
    - Shows an alert if the user is not authenticated, preventing the TypeError.
    - Added comments for clarity.
- **Why:**
  - Prevents TinyMCE 6+ warnings and ensures future compatibility.
  - Keeps the codebase clean and up-to-date.
  - Prevents runtime errors and provides a better user experience if the user is not logged in.

### Consistent Post Image Sizing in PostCard
- **User Request:** Post images on the home page were misaligned and inconsistent in size.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `src/components/PostCard.jsx`:
    - Set a fixed height (`h-64`), full width (`w-full`), and `object-cover` for all post images.
    - Ensures all post images are uniform, aligned, and visually consistent in the grid.
    - Added comments for clarity.
- **Why:**
  - Provides a clean, professional, and visually appealing layout for all post cards.
  - Prevents images from appearing too large or too small compared to others.

### Vercel Deployment Fix
- **User Request:** Ensure the app deploys correctly on Vercel, especially regarding React and TinyMCE dependencies.
- **Action:**
  - Created `vercel.json` in the project root with the following content:
    ```json
    {
      "build": {
        "env": {
          "NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS": "true"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - This configuration forces Vercel to use `--legacy-peer-deps` during `npm install`, resolving the React/TinyMCE dependency conflict.
- **Why:**
  - Ensures a smooth deployment process on Vercel, preventing potential issues with peer dependencies.

### TinyMCE Domain Registration Fix
- **User Request:** TinyMCE editor showed a warning about the domain not being registered after deployment to Vercel.
- **Action:**
  - Registered the deployed Vercel domain (`react-appwrite-blog-app.vercel.app`) in the TinyMCE Cloud dashboard under the API key's allowed domains.
  - This removed the warning and enabled TinyMCE to work on the production site.
- **Why:**
  - TinyMCE requires all production domains to be registered for API key usage. This is necessary for the editor to function without warnings or restrictions on deployed sites.

### Vercel SPA Routing Fix
- **User Request:** Refreshing a non-root route on the deployed Vercel site caused a crash or 404 error.
- **Action:**
  - Updated `vercel.json` to add a rewrite rule:
    ```json
    {
      "rewrites": [
        { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
      ],
      "build": {
        "env": {
          "NPM_CONFIG_LEGACY_PEER_DEPS": "true"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - This ensures all routes are served by `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.
- **Why:**
  - Fixes the issue where refreshing or directly visiting a nested route would break the app on Vercel deployments.
